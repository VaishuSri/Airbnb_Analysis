# Airbnb_Analysis
In order to obtain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends, this project will use MongoDB Atlas to analyze Airbnb data, execute data cleaning and preparation, produce interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots. Creating a MongoDB connection, obtaining the Airbnb dataset, and guaranteeing effective data retrieval for analysis are the goals.
To ensure reliable analysis, clean and prepare the dataset by correcting duplicates, missing values, and data type conversions.

Provide a well-lit, interactive web application that allows users to investigate prices, ratings, and other pertinent aspects while viewing the distribution of Airbnb listings via interactive maps.

Utilize dynamic plots and charts to conduct pricing analysis and visualization, investigating variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
Examine availability trends by season and use appropriate visualizations to show changes in demand and occupancy rates.
Examine location-based insights by gathering and displaying information for particular areas or communities.

Make interactive data visualizations that let consumers explore and filter the information.
Using Tableau or Power BI, create a complete dashboard that presents the most important findings from the investigation by merging multiple visuals.
